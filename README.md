# 42_GNL
Get next line from a file

This project was done as part of my education at Codam, part of the 42 network of coding schools.

<h3>Assignment</h3>

The object is to write a function that retrieves a line from a file descriptor (a line being defined as ending with
either '\n'of 'EOF'). The function must consist of a maximum of 5 functions with at most 25 lines per function.

As a bonus, I used only one static variable and wrote my program in a way that supports multiple file descriptors 
(i.e. My program can keep track of where it has stopped reading and pick up the thread there for multiple files at 
the same time)
